# MCP Memory Ruleset

- Always log every significant edit, configuration change, or troubleshooting step as a new memory entity or observation.
- When performing a task, recall and reference all relevant memory entities, logs, or context items related to that task.
- Maintain a chronological and categorized memory log for easy querying and review.
- For each new file, configuration, or rule added, create a memory entry describing its purpose and usage.
- When recalling, prioritize the most recent and most relevant memory items for the current context.
- Ensure memory is persistent, queryable, and accessible for both automated and manual review.
